.md file is a very usefile file type which can be used for a better readme/documentations file. 
Few important command/comment type are given to easily modify the file. 


For header or making the font big we can use this command (also used is python to comment out lines)
# Header/ Big font/ type your text here

To show that there is a code/command you can use this-
`<!-- This will be shown as code, not as a comment -->`

TO give a comment which can only be seen in the text editor/code you can use this, this will not be visible on the .md preview 
<!-- this will not be seen on the .md preview but it will take space -->
